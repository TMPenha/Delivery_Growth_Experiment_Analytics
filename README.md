# Growth Experiment Analytics

## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of a promotional A/B experiment designed to evaluate how discount incentives affect user behavior, retention, and revenue. The goal is to combine data engineering, statistical analysis, and business reasoning to guide data-driven growth decisions.

The analysis simulates a real-world growth experiment pipeline, from raw data processing to actionable business insights.

---

## Objectives

- Build a clean analytical dataset from raw sources
- Evaluate experiment impact using A/B testing
- Identify behavioral segments with different responses
- Estimate financial viability of the promotion
- Recommend strategic improvements

---

## Methodology

The project follows a structured analytics pipeline:

Raw data → ETL → Analytical dataset → A/B analysis → Segmentation → Business insights


## Key components:

- Apache Spark for scalable ETL
- Statistical comparison of test vs control groups
- Behavioral segmentation analysis
- ROI modeling and business recommendations
